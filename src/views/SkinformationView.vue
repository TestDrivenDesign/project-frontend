    <h2>What is skin cancer and what it does?</h2>
    <p>
      Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent forms of cancer and can appear anywhere on the skin.
      Most common are non-melanoma skin cancers, like Basal Cell Carcinoma and Squamous Cell
      Carcinoma.The first signs of non-melanoma cancers are often patches or lesions on the skin
      that show unnatural growth. <br />
      <br />
      Cases of skin cancer have been on the rise for decades now. When detected early, most skin
      cancer types can be treated. That's why it is important to check your skin regularly for any
      irregularities and see a doctor whenever you are concerned about something.

They can start to destroy surrounding skin if they are left to continue to enlarge over time.Most Basal cell carcinomas are painless, although sometimes they can be itchy or bleed.`,
