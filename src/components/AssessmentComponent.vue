They usually grow slowly, and they rarely spread to other parts of the body.Basal cell carcinomas can occur anywhere on the body but are most common in areas that are exposed to the sun such as your face, head, neck, and ears.If left untreated, Basal cell carcinomas will continue to grow and can eventually cause an ulcer; hence they can have the name 'rodent ulcer'. They can start to destroy surrounding skin if they are left to continue to enlarge over time.Most Basal cell carcinomas are painless, although sometimes they can be itchy or bleed. Check out our skinformation section for more details."

Check out our skinformation section for more details.'

In most cases, melanomas have an irregular shape and more than 1 colour. They may also be larger than normal moles and can sometimes be itchy or bleed.

Common nevi are harmless collections of colored cells. They typically appear as small brown, tan, or pink spots. You can be born with moles or develop them later. Moles that youâ€™re born with are known as congenital moles. However, most moles develop during childhood and adolescence. This is known as an acquired nevus. Moles can also develop later in life as a result of sun exposure. There are many types of nevi. Some of them are harmless and others more serious. Read on to learn about the different types and how to know whether you should get one checked out by your doctor. Check out our skinformation section for more details.'

While these birthmarks can look similar at times, they each vary in terms of origin and necessary treatment. Check out our skinformation section for more details.'
